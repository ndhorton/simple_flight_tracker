Home page
We want user account functionality
After the user logs in we want the home page to list existing flights, if any
and offer a way to add flights and delete flights


Suggested fields:
* airline --- too many for simple validation from a definitive list
* flight number --- two-letter airline designator and 1- to 4-digit number
* destination --- like for airline, just validate field not empty
* departure time --- maybe look back at LS202 for ideas on input type
